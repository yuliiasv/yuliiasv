## 👋 Hi, I'm Yuliia — Senior QA Analyst | QA Lead | Mentor

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Senior QA Analyst with 10+ years of experience testing web products, embedded systems, and banking applications.
## 🌿 About Me

- 📍 Based in Victoria, BC 🇨🇦 — open to collaboration, mentoring, and meaningful QA conversations.  
- 🧠 I believe in **feedback-driven development** — every bug is a gift, every fix is a step toward excellence.  
- 💬 My QA motto:  
  > *If I’m wrong — the software works as expected.*  
  > *If I’m right — I’ve found a bug that can now be fixed.*  
  > *Either way, we’ve just improved quality.*  

Quality is not just my job — it’s my mindset.

## 🔍 What I do

- 🧪 **Manual & Exploratory Testing** — from happy paths to edge cases  
- 🧰 **API Testing** — Postman, Swagger  
- 🧬 **Automation Foundations** — Python (Pytest) and Cypress for UI/API coverage  
- 📊 **Requirements Analysis & QA Documentation** — test plans, checklists, test cases  
- 🎯 **Agile Testing** — cross-functional collaboration, Scrum ceremonies, continuous improvement  
- 🤝 **Mentoring** — supporting junior testers and driving team knowledge-sharing

## 🚀 Where I'm going

Although my roots are in testing, I’m actively building skills in:

- 🧠 **Agile leadership** — Scrum Mastery, team facilitation, process improvement  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Mentorship** — I believe in growing others as we grow ourselves  
- 🔁 **Test strategy & delegation** — focusing on quality outcomes, not just outputs  
- 🧬 **Human-centered QA** — inspired by productivity science, cognitive psychology, and longevity

I’m fascinated by how the brain works, how people learn, and how to work with deep focus and clarity. These interests guide how I build testing strategies, lead teams, and grow as  QA Lead.

## 🤖 What I'm exploring now: AI for QA & Agile Teams

I'm deeply curious about how AI can become a real team member, not just a tool. I'm experimenting with:

- Using AI to generate edge-case test scenarios, test plans, and exploratory ideas
- Prompt design for QA context — making AI think like a tester
- Integrating AI into Agile rituals — using it for retrospective summaries, acceptance criteria analysis, and user story grooming
- Training teammates on how to work with AI ethically and effectively

My goal is to **build hybrid teams** where humans and AI collaborate for better quality, faster cycles, and smarter processes.

## 🧠 Side Passions

- ✨ Lifelong learning & neuroproductivity  
- ⏳ Longevity & biohacking  
- 🎨 Creative thinking & growth mindset  
- 👥 People-first leadership
